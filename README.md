# Issues
### Compile issues:
There are some compile issues thanks to the update of the mainline ns-3, and I fixed them through this [commit](https://github.com/Mauriyin/ns3/commit/8cad2d6d26d4880da6aa79ef85153a6c3ab79afd). I commented on the parts that are not used and when I put them back to your 11ac [repo](https://github.com/kajihara-ry/ns3-11ac), it had the same results. So I am confident these modifications are right to do.
### Throughput issue:
If I run on this version above, the UDP server only sends one packet. I've noticed that this is because the variable is set to true:
```
filterOutNonAddbaEstablished = true
```
I make some changes in this [commit](https://github.com/Mauriyin/ns3/commit/c5353d6de06750369ea96ad53455adcb360e44c5) and then the packets are sending successfully. However, the throughput is low and unequal compared with the one in your [repo](https://github.com/kajihara-ry/ns3-11ac).
